Tool to interactively manipulate affine transformations of plots


This application is intended to be a helpful introduction and teaching aid for visualizing affine transformations, especially their action on points, graphics, and plots of curves.

**Usage:** 
To use this demo, start by evaluating all initialization cells and scroll down to the graph. You can click and drag the tips of the red and blue vectors/arrows to control the action of the transformation on the standard basis. Additionally, you can drag the tail (back) of the vectors away from (0,0) to add a translation. You can also use the controls & fields on the left  to control the translation & stretching / shearing effects.
By default you will see a grid of points and lines, a unit circle, a parabolic polar plot and a hyperbola from a ContourPlot as well as a triangle. Changing the vectors will stretch and manipulate the graphics according to the transformation you choose.
